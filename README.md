## **Getting Started**

Follow the instructions below to set up and run ECSY on your system.

### **Prerequisites**
- **Python 3.8+**: Required for ECSY and its dependencies.
- **TensorFlow 2.x**: For running pre-trained or custom AI models.
- **PyTorch**: For dynamic deep learning experiments.
- GPU support is recommended but optional (requires CUDA).

### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/uendellmagno/ECSY.git
   cd ECSY
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Verify TensorFlow and PyTorch installations:
   ```bash
   python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"
   python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
   ```

## **Usage**

ECSY supports a wide range of features, from machine learning pipelines to natural language interfaces.

### Running the Assistant
1. Start the main ECSY service:
   ```bash
   python ecsy.py
   ```
2. Interact with ECSY using the command-line interface or REST API.

### Example Commands
- **Run Pre-trained Model**: `"Analyze this image using the YOLOv5 model."`
- **Custom Query**: `"What‚Äôs the sentiment of this text?"`

### Customization
- **Custom Models**: Add your TensorFlow or PyTorch models in the `models/` directory.
- **Pipelines**: Modify the `pipelines.py` file to integrate custom workflows.

## **Development**

ECSY was built with a focus on modularity and ease of experimentation.

### Extending ECSY
1. Add a new module:
   - Create a new `.py` file in the `modules/` directory.
   - Implement your custom logic and register it in `ecsy.py`.

2. Add or update machine learning models:
   - Place your TensorFlow or PyTorch models in the `models/` directory.
   - Ensure dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
